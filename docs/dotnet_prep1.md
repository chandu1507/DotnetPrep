Perfect! Let’s dive into the **SOLID principles**—these are the backbone of maintainable, extensible, and testable enterprise .NET applications.
For each, I’ll give:

* **What it means (in your own words)**
* **Enterprise example** (not “shapes” or “animals”—real modules)
* **Why it matters in a real team/project**
* **Common pitfalls**

---

## **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Every class should have one, and only one, reason to change.**

**Real Enterprise Example:**
In a **Leave Management System**:

* `LeaveRequestService` should only handle business logic for leave applications (validations, balance checks).
* `LeaveRequestRepository` should only talk to the database (CRUD for leave requests).
* `LeaveNotificationService` should only handle notifications (emails/SMS for approvals/rejections).

**Why?**
If the business rule for leave balance changes, you only modify the `LeaveRequestService`. If the DB schema changes, only the repository is affected.

**Common Pitfall:**
Classes doing everything—business logic, data access, email sending—end up impossible to maintain and test.

---

## **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

**Real Enterprise Example:**
In an **Invoice Generation module**:

* You have to add new invoice types (GST Invoice, Export Invoice) as regulations change.
* Design a base `InvoiceGenerator` interface and concrete classes for each type:

  ```csharp
  public interface IInvoiceGenerator { void Generate(InvoiceData data); }
  public class GSTInvoiceGenerator : IInvoiceGenerator { ... }
  public class ExportInvoiceGenerator : IInvoiceGenerator { ... }
  ```
* When a new invoice type is added, just add a new class, don’t touch the core processing logic.

**Why?**
Prevents bugs when adding features—existing code isn’t changed (so regressions are rare).

**Common Pitfall:**
Giant switch/case statements—every new type requires editing old code, risking bugs.

---

## **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Subclasses should be substitutable for their base class without breaking client code.**

**Real Enterprise Example:**
In a **Banking System**:

* `Account` base class, `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` derived classes.
* Client code should be able to use either type and always have valid behavior:

  ```csharp
  List<Account> accounts = new() { new SavingsAccount(), new CurrentAccount() };
  foreach(var acc in accounts) acc.Withdraw(amount); // Works for all
  ```

**Why?**
Prevents surprises—if your subclass changes the contract (e.g., throws NotImplemented on Withdraw), you’ll break parts of the system unexpectedly.

**Common Pitfall:**
Derived classes that override methods to throw exceptions or do nothing—violates LSP.

---

## **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**

**Real Enterprise Example:**
In a **User Management module**:

* Instead of one giant `IUserService` with 30+ methods, split it:

  ```csharp
  public interface IAuthenticationService { void Login(); }
  public interface IProfileService { void UpdateProfile(); }
  ```
* Admin panel only needs `IProfileService`, login page only needs `IAuthenticationService`.

**Why?**
Keeps code focused, easier to mock in unit tests, less fragile to changes.

**Common Pitfall:**
Fat interfaces where a change for one client breaks or complicates things for others.

---

## **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions.**

**Real Enterprise Example:**
In an **Order Processing System**:

* The `OrderService` uses an interface `IPaymentGateway` instead of concrete classes like `StripePaymentGateway` or `PayPalGateway`.
* Swap implementations with zero changes to the `OrderService`.

  ```csharp
  public class OrderService
  {
      private readonly IPaymentGateway _gateway;
      public OrderService(IPaymentGateway gateway) { _gateway = gateway; }
  }
  ```

**Why?**
Improves testability (mock the gateway), makes switching vendors or logic painless, supports Dependency Injection frameworks.

**Common Pitfall:**
Directly instantiating dependencies inside classes, making code rigid and untestable.

## **How to Demonstrate SOLID in Interviews**

* **Talk about refactoring:** “We split our monolithic UserService into focused services for auth, profile, and roles to reduce bugs and improve maintainability (SRP, ISP).”
* **Explain extension:** “When GST laws changed, we just added a new invoice generator—existing code didn’t change (OCP).”
* **Testing and flexibility:** “Using interfaces for repositories and services made it easy to mock dependencies for unit testing (DIP).”
* **Bug prevention:** “We found subclasses were breaking parent contracts, so we enforced LSP and fixed broken polymorphism.”
